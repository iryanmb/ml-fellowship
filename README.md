# Machine Learning Fellowship Portfolio

This repository contains applied machine learning lab projects completed during the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship (Summer 2025). The projects cover the full machine learning pipeline, from business understanding and problem formulation to data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

## Projects

- **Week1 - ML_Lifecycle**  
  Problem formulation and understanding the ML lifecycle using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- **Week2 - Data_Exploration**  
  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on structured datasets; summary statistics, visualizations, and insights.

- **Week3 - Feature_Engineering**  
  Creating, selecting, and transforming features to improve machine learning models.

- **Week4 - Model_Development**  
  Building supervised learning models using scikit-learn, including classification and regression.

- **Week5 - Model_Evaluation**  
  Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

- **Week6 - Advanced_Topics**  
  Exploring advanced topics such as ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning, or interpretability (based on lab focus).

## Tools and Libraries

- Python, Jupyter Notebooks  
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## About the Fellowship
