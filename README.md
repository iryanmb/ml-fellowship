# Machine Learning Fellowship Portfolio

This repository contains applied machine learning lab projects completed during the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship (Summer 2025). The projects cover the full machine learning pipeline, from business understanding and problem formulation to data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

## Projects

- **Week1 - ML Lifecycle & Problem Formation**  
  Problem formulation and understanding the ML lifecycle using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- **Week2 - Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**  
  Handling outliers and missing data; one-hot encoding categorical features; identifying correlations; bivariate visualizations; exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- **Week3 - Decision Trees & K-Nearest Neighbors**  
  Decision tree classifiers; K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers; one-hot encoding with scikit-learn;  hyperparameter tuning; accuracy evaluation.

- **Week4 - Logistic Regression From Scracth & Scikit-Learn**  
  Implementing logistic regression from scratch; comparing custom implementation with scikit-learnâ€™s LogisticRegression.
  
- **Week5 - Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Selection**  
  Logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV); evaluating models with precision-recall and ROC curves; AUC scores; feature selection (SelectKBest).

- **Week6 - Regression & EnsembleMethods**  
  Ensemble methods including stacking regressor, gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), and random forest regressor; performance visualization and comparison.
